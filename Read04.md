## 6 Steps to make a wireframe

### 1.do your research

- UX design is a process, and wireframing is not the first step in this process.
- creating user personas and defining use cases
- prevailing UX trends and best practices

### 2.Prepare your research for reference

> scribbling a cheatsheet with your business and user goals (your requirements), your personas, use cases, and perhaps some reminders of the coolest features you stumbled across in your competitor research. A few choice quotes from your audience might also help focus your attention on the user’s experience, which is—never forget—what you’re designing!

### 3.Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

> If you’re already well-acquainted with UX vocabulary, your internal voice will be alternately screaming “user flows” and “information architecture”.

### 4.Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate

>while you’re sketching:<br>
&nbsp; 
How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

### 5.Add some detail and get testing

>These elements are the ligaments and tendons that will connect form and functionality. Think about the following:<br>
&nbsp;
-Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on<br>
-Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action<br>
-Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?<br>
-Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
