# Reading Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide

## Version Control

**a system that allows you revisit various versions of a file by recording changes**

    - revert a file to previous version

    - track modification and modify individulas

    - compare changes

&nbsp;
### 1. Local Version Control

**entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files**

&nbsp;
### 2. Centralized Version Control(CVCS)
**allows collaboration within a developer team**

    - can be accessed by various clients

    - programmers can have more knowledge of team members' activities with certain files

    - give administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

&nbsp;
### 3. Distributed Version Control(DVCS)
**Addresses major vulnerability of CVS: the server as a single point of failure**

> Situation 1: collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions 

> Situation 2: if central database's hard disk is corrupted, the work will be lost
    
    - allows clients to create mirrored repositories

    - multiple mirrored repositories allows programmers working with each other in various way to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows

&nbsp;
### 4. So, What is Git?
&nbsp;
>**_Snapshots_** <br>
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots

- each time you save a changed version(commit), Git creates a snapshot of file and stores a reference to it.

&nbsp;
>**_Local Operations_**<br>
Git relies on local operations.

- Eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server.

- Allows working without online or VPN

&nbsp;
>**_Tracking Changes_**<br>
Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

&nbsp;
>**_Loss of Data_**<br>
Git minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files.

&nbsp;
>**_States_**<br>
files in Git can reside in three main states:
- Committed: stored in local database

- Modified: has been changed but not committed to the database

- Stated: flagged a file's changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

&nbsp;
## History of Git
**allows non-linear development via multiple branches, support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruptions**

&nbsp;
## Getting Started

### Download Git
    Git can be installed in three ways:
    1. install as a package

    2. install via another installer

    3. download and compile the source code.
